## Intro
The [Serpens-Employee-Recognition] (http://serpenscapstone.azurewebsites.net/) project is a database backed website that will allow users to create employee recognition awards. The awards are PDF certificates that are emailed to the winners. There will also be an administrative backend that will allow the admins to manage user accounts and perform business intelligence operations.  The requirements for this project can be found [here] (https://oregonstate.instructure.com/courses/1642213/pages/web3-employee-recognition).
